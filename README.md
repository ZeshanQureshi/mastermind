# Mastermind

Welcome to Mastermind!

## Running the Program

Download the repository code. From a console, navigate to the directory with the repository code and run the command **ruby lib/mastermind.rb**

## How it Works

If playing as code breaker, the player will have 12 guesses to try to break a 4 digit code consisting of numbers from 1 to 6. If you guess the correct digit but incorrect position you'll see **○**. If you guess the correct digit and the correct position you'll see **•**. 

If playing as code setter, the player will set a 4 digit key consisting of numbers 1 to 6. The computer will try to guess the code.

If the code is cracked in under 12 guesses, the code breaker wins else, if the code is not cracked in under 12 guesses, the code setter will win.
